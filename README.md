# Rain Monitor
This is a combination Raspberry Pi with a custom RPi HAT PCB.

The RPi runs a Python program which monitors past & future weather.  Based on parameters set in a INI file,
determines if the sprinker should water the yard.  If watering is not to occur, a relay on the PCB is switched
to inhibit the sprinkler from watering.
